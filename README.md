# GeoBot
A simple python project for retrieving a list of geodesic coordinates from Google. You need a personal API-key from Google. The project is without dependencies and based only on python libraries included in the standard installation.
The program reads an input file named list.txt, containing the address to find (one per line) and outputs the coordinates into a file called coordinates.txt
